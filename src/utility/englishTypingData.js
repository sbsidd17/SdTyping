        title : `1.Pressure of successful`,
        paragraph : `Pressure of successful recruitment on organizations is making the HRs adopt modern practices to ensure fairness and efficiency in the hiring process. From identifying the right channel to source the desired candidate and potentially fast-tracking them through proper recruitment and onboarding procedures, HRs are looking at optimizing the entire process and cost. A successful and organized recruitment procedure can assist in finding a talent aligned with the brand values, culture, and purpose. Due to the onset of the pandemic, the majority of hiring processes have moved to virtual space, integrating advanced technologies. Organizations are deploying new-age strategies that not only expedite the hiring process but also eliminate bias in assessing candidates and provide insights for data-driven decision-making. Adopting a digitised approach Technology has become an indispensable part of every function and it has replaced the manual process with automated ones. Similarly, talent managers also need to adopt an automated approach when it comes to hiring with efficiency. Embedding technology tools can replace their repeated mundane tasks without requiring their valuable time and skills to be wasted on manual execution. Unfortunately, several organizations still require their employees to spend hours completing time-consuming tasks. By automating the recruitment process, talent managers can spend more time analyzing the candidates data and finding the ones with requisite skills. Expanding the horizon to remote workers Prior to the pandemic, it was hard for organizations to think about having full-time remote workers. However, the overnight shifting of office work to virtual space has settled the remote work challenges and concurred that having a remote workforce is possible. As a result, talent managers now get a larger pool of potential candidates because geography no longer remains a barrier. In addition, it also contributes to an organisation diversity, equity and inclusion policy by having employees belonging to different territories and cultures. Establishing a leadership culture Promoting a sense of ownership in employees breeds leaders of tomorrow. Hence, designing a strategy that empowers the culture of leadership within the company can help talent managers attract better talent in the industry. Superior talent in an organisation gives new wings to business. This can be nurtured by providing innovative leadership training to employees who can further provide a competitive edge to the organisation. Therefore, exhibiting ownership culture and high-performance variability can prove to be a game-changer in building a stronger workforce. Considering internal mobility Depending on external knowledge and sources remains top of the mind of talent managers while finding the much-needed skills. However, this strategy can be time-consuming as well as expensive. Talent managers often overlook the internal promotions or benefit of internal mobility in filling up open positions. As a robust hiring solution, talent managers must leverage the existing relationship in their existing employee base that can accelerate productivity with much efficiency. As per the data companies that leverage internal mobility reportedly retained employees for 5.4 years. Adopting employee flexibility No candidate wants to join a workplace where employees feel exhausted. Talent managers must explore ways to offer flexibility.`

        title : `2.Hindus the Answer`,
        paragraph : `Hindus the answer lies in the appeasement of the influential Muslim clergy & the upper crust of the Muslim community by the Congress leadership led by Mahatma Gandhi, purportedly to counter the British policy of Divide & Rule. Following this policy Gandhi supported the Khilafat Movement, a divisive movement which turned into a communal movement culminating into genocide of Hindus in Malabar. It is noteworthy that Khilafat Movement was opposed by Jinnah whereas Mauling Abu Kalama Azad had supported it. The genocide of hapless Hindus prompted Dr. Hedge war conceives an organization of Hindus. This led to the formation of RSS in 1925. Now that RSS has grown into a force to reckon with, the present Chief of RSS, Dr. Mohan Bhagwat has embarked on the mission to bring the Muslim Community into the mainstream which Congress did not do in pursuit of its narrow political interest or rather alienated the community. With the response he is getting from the intelligentsia and certain sections of the Muslim Community, it is hoped, the bond between the Hindus & Muslims will be strengthened, who have for generations lived harmoniously. Today, with the complexity of designs that we witness worldwide, a digital uprising is very critical. As architects and designers, we must actively invest in newer technology and innovations with in the construction industry to allow stakeholders to save time and money and go paperless in the long run, moving towards environmental sustainability. Modern-day structures are a combination of various interconnected elements and resultants of complex calculations. Ensuring this momentous task is carried out with utmost precision requires a blend of competencies and digital aid. The adoption of various technologies in construction works can enable professionals to save time, improve the quality of work, reduce costs, focus on safety parameters, and increase profit margins. Digitisation can also streamline business models and practices with proper tracking measures, thereby providing transparency and allowing us to collect data, track materials and working hours for effective planning. Incorporating technology also boosts productivity, increases efficiency and reduces project delivery time as communication on projects improves, reducing the scope for confusion and errors. In the present day, continually evolving technology has further strengthened the usage of digital tools such as BIM a popular tool with integrated design practices. This has enabled architecture and engineering to streamline and improve on the lines of quality, accuracy and innovation. Additionally, various 3D integrated design and analysis is software have made construction operations easier by carrying out complex simulations. As a result, such software and tools have become widely popular among architects and designers. Digitised Operations Embracing the Change The construction industry consists of many organizations that are either unprepared for or overwhelmed by the magnitude of new and emerging technologies. The increasing desire for organizations to switch to digital operations is further reinforced by their intent to limit the usage of resources such as paper. This saves enormous printing costs, precious time and storage in a modern-day workspace. In addition, information management.`

        title : `3.And knowledge transfer`,
        paragraph : `And knowledge transfer have become a swift process with digitised operations. But, the major challenge the construction industry faces today is smoother communication amongst different stakeholders in the timely completion of projects. Projects are dynamic and often require numerous changes and modifications throughout their lifecycle, especially from the schematic to the completion stage. While we have all progressed towards utilising digital platforms for smooth communication and managing documentation and timeline through various platforms, there still needs to be a seamless integration of everything that is dynamic and acts as a way of communication amongst different stakeholders. This calls for a dire need for digital transformation in the construction sector, especially post-pandemic, with a digitally enabled workforce. Globally, the adoption of technology has enabled firms offering design and construction services to identify inefficiencies, curate an implementation strategy and employ the right personnel. By incorporating advanced technology, integrated practices offering design and engineering consultation seek to increase profitability, streamline processes, reduce project risks, and bring efficiency in their design coordination by pre-empting clashes in design and providing value addition to the designed product. Boosting productivity with technology In the era of pursuing integrated operations, collaboration becomes paramount. Architects use technology platforms such as BIM, allowing effective collaboration with engineers and contractors regarding the designs of projects. With the growing popularity of BIM modeling, using 3D modeling software has become a must for Government projects in certain countries and is increasingly being requested for private projects of all sizes. In regards to ensuring a hazard-free work environment, Augmented Reality (AR)provides an overlay of digital information on top of the real world. Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) allows software access to phones, thus reducing the usage of high-end laptops and desktops for real-time updates. Additionally, Virtual Reality (VR) enables designers to model structures and simulate them as per various real-world scenarios. Using drones for inspections and surveys cuts down the time involved and the usage of resources. Similarly, the Internet of Things (Iota) manages a plethora of technology and optimizes the use of resources with effective planning and connecting everyone on the team. The future of the Indian built environment has tremendous potential to develop complex structures in challenging environments with diverse social and climatic conditions. The economic narrative on projects must allocate room for enabling state-of-the-art technology on large-scale projects. With multiple stakeholders involved in a project, time management becomes a necessity making collaboration the key to operating in the industry. Technology, when used to its utmost potential, can enable communication to increase between the field and the office.
